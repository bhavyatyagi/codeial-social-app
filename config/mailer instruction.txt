What are required stuff?

-nodemailer
-config
-mailers
-templates

whya re we using so many padckages: because someone has worked hard on it and we can right now use it, later we can make our own packages also
npm i nodemailer
 1. make nodemailer.js in config and add appropriate details from doc
 2. Suppose we are making a mailer for new comments then we will create a new file in the mailers folder.
 3. we will require nodemailer there and export a function/module from there so that a mail can go to the user who adds a new comment.
 4. Next go to comments controller and populate the User of Comment instead of checking req.hxr beforehand so that we can access it in comments mailer.
 5. Import this comments mailer in comments controller andd use or call it whereever required
