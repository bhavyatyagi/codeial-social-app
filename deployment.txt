1. Create environment.js in config and place all the static paths and passwords there. and use env vaariable to access them back in main index.js
    Basic step is wherever u want to change value with env.variable create a var in environment.js in config and require env in the file u took value from and access it using env.var
    repeat this for paths, db, secrets, keys

    This was just for development level keys
2. Now we will make production level enviornment where our keys wont be visible and wont be in the code
