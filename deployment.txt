1. Create environment.js in config and place all the static paths and passwords there. and use env vaariable to access them back in main index.js
    Basic step is wherever u want to change value with env.variable create a var in environment.js in config and require env in the file u took value from and access it using env.var
    repeat this for paths, db, secrets, keys

    This was just for development level keys
2. Now we will make production level enviornment where our keys wont be visible and wont be in the code 
    In bash 
        vi ~/.bash_profile
        - export your varaibales and use them as process.env.varName in the env.js
        source ~/.bash_profile [this is done to update the file]

    Add every new var and assign them in the production module.
    
3. After this for production logs we install morgan and rotating file stream
4. include rfs,path,fs in env.js and include morgan details in both prod and dev modules and compelte the env.js file
 - This should add new folder/files to the project and our access logs will be being saved

5. Using GULP, make a file gulpfile.js in the main folder besides index.js installing rep, cssnano, gulp-sass, gulp etc. and add appropriate details to the file
